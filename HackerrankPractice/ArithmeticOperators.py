# Arithmetic Operators 

# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where: 
# 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers. 
# 2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second)
# 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers. 
# Input Format
# The first line contains the first integer, a 
# The second line contains the second integer, b
# Constraints
# 1 <= a <= 10^10
# 1 <= b <= 10^10
# Output
# Print the three lines as explained above.

# Asking the user to enter two values
a = int(input())

b = int(input())

# First line contains the sum of the two numbers 
print(a + b)

# Second line contains the difference of thw two numbers (first - second)
print(a - b)

# Third line contains the product of the two numbers 
print(a * b)
